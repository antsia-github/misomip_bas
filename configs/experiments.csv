18-Oct-18,e,"re-instated 1m minimum, correct Ocean2 geometry",bottom temperatures looked bad --> all restoring TYP profiles had been wrong (!),yes,no,/nerc/n02/n02/chbull/RawData/NEMO/isomip/isomip_redux
16-Nov-18,f,"fixed restoring profile, re-tuned gammat",weird slugs on sidewalls and different masking on sidewalls depending on Ocean0/1/2,yes,?,/nerc/n02/n02/chbull/RawData/NEMO/isomip/isomip_redux
17-Dec-18,f2,robin fixed the interpolation scripts for the sign of the bsf and the weird slugs (masking issue). This was not re-runs of NEMO just the interpolation step and only for TYP.,,yes,?,/fs2/n02/shared/robin/MISOMIP/Ocean?_TYP_NEMO-UKESM1is.nc-f
